# What this PR is about?

## If it is a new question for the website

> Give your PR title a name like this: `feat(question): choice 1 or choice 2`

> Upload a screenshot of the question taken from your localhost environment

Be careful, a question for choiceof.dev must be an opposition of two choices you really don't want to make. If you do `React.js or Vue.js` it is not a question good for this website because it is just a matter of personal preference. Both choices must be painful. Also, try to find funny images to illustrate your choices. Putting screenshot of codes or IDE is definitely not funny enough.

Your PR will be reviewed and our CI will run some tests and checks. If everything is fine, and the joke is fun, we will merge it and your question will be available on the website ðŸŽ‰
